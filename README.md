Memory management is the process of efficiently managing computer memory (RAM).
It involves allocating a piece of memory at run-time to the program when the program 
requests it and freeing the allocated memory for re-use when the program no longer needs it.
Understanding the internals of memory management in Python helps in designing memory-efficient
applications. It also makes it easier to debug memory issues in an application.
